# Areas

This outlines the areas we need to correct to prevent 1095A update notification from being fired when we are 'only' setting 12/31 end dates on IVL policies.

This includes cases where we need to switch carriers and do end up transmitting an end-of-year termination.

# Cases To Correct

1. COR
   1. ~~carrier_switch.rb~~
   2. *carrier_switch_renewal.rb
   3. *dependent_drop.rb
   4. *market_change.rb
   5. *renewal_dependent_drop.rb
   6. ~~termination.rb~~
2. UI Initiated Changes
3. EDI Import

# Cases to Ignore and Why

1. Individual Updates - triggers no policy end-date changes
2. Observer - we can't rely on versioning of sub-documents to be correct, thus we can't solve this problem at a single location by version comparison
3. COR
   1. assistance_change.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   2. active_renewal.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   3.  cobra_new_policy_reinstate.rb - cobra doesn't apply to IVL
   4.  cobra_new_policy_switchover.rb - cobra doesn't apply to IVL
   5. cobra_switchover.rb - cobra doesn't apply to IVL
   6. cobra_reinstate.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   7. dependent_add.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   8. initial_enrollment.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   9.  new_policy_reinstate.rb
   10. passive_renewal.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   11. plan_change.rb - can't happen at end of year, must happen during the year
   12. plan_change_dependent_add.rb - can't happen at end of year, must happen during the year
   13. plan_change_dependent_drop.rb - can't happen at end of year, must happen during the year
   14. renewal_dependent_add.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   15. terminate_policy_with_earlier_date.rb - not possible for the termination date to be the same as the latest possible termination date (which is the end of the year)
   16. reinstate.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
   17. reselection_of_existing_coverage.rb - triggers no kinds of termination
